    <h1>Chicken Recipes</h1>

    <p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. 
    I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. 
    It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <h5>Step One</h5>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <h5>Step Two</h5>
        <p>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. 
            Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior.
             Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</p>
         <h5>Step Three</h5>
         <p>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
              Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings.
              Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</p>
